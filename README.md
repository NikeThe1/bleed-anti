# Overview

Hello, I've made an accurate similar clone of the Discord bot as you all may know as "bleed". This development will only feature the most known and used part to bleed, the **antinuke** function. I've made some additional changes and checks as bleed didn't have those checks and also added antinuke logs for events. This project only supports MongoDB so you can click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ6J24gjPy0&pp=ygUQbW9uZ28gZGlzY29yZCBqcw%3D%3D) to learn how to setup the database.

# Disclaimer

This development is only to fit a beginners standpoint, if it's hard coded, who cares.
