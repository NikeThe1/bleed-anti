# Overview

Hello, I've made an accurate similar clone of the Discord bot as you all may know as "bleed". This development will only feature the most known and used part to bleed, the **antinuke** function. I've made some additional changes and checks as bleed didn't have those checks and also added antinuke logs for events.

# Disclaimer

This development is only to fit a beginners standpoint, if it's hard coded, who cares.

# Features

- Role Deletion
- Webhook Creation
- Mass Member Bans
- Channel Creation/Deletion
- Mass Member Kicks
- Emoji Deletion
- Vanity Protection
- Community Spam Detection
- Watching permissions grants/removals
